Queen of Hearts : Who's been painting my roses red? WHO'S BEEN PAINTING MY ROSES RED? /Who dares to taint / With vulgar paint / The royal flower bed? / For painting my roses red / Someone will lose his head.

Card Painter : Oh no, Your Majesty, please! It's all *his* fault!

Card Painter : Not me, your grace! The ace, the ace!

Queen of Hearts : You?

Card Painter : No, two!

Queen of Hearts : The deuce, you say?

Card Painter : Not me! The three!

Queen of Hearts : That's enough! Off with their heads!
